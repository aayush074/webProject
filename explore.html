            <h1>LUMBINI</h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Lumbinī </strong>(Nepali: लुम्बिनी pronounced [ˈlumbini]
              (listen), "the lovely") is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the
              Rupandehi District of Lumbini Province in Nepal. It is the place
              where, according to Buddhist tradition, queen Maya gave birth to
              Siddhartha Gautama at around 566 BCE. Gautama, who, according to
              Buddhist tradition, achieved Enlightenment some time around 528
              BCE, became Shakyamuni Buddha and founded Buddhism. Lumbini is one
              of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to
              the life of the Buddha. Lumbini has a number of old temples,
              including the Mayadevi Temple, and several new temples, funded by
              Buddhist organisations from various countries. Most of the temples
              have already been completed and some are still under construction.
              Many monuments, monasteries and a museum, and the Lumbini
              International Research Institute are also within the holy site.
              Also, there is the Puskarini, or Holy Pond, where Mayadevi, the
              Buddha's mother, is believed to have taken the ritual dip prior to
              his birth and where he also had his first bath. At other sites
              near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to tradition, born,
              then achieved ultimate Enlightenment and finally relinquished
              their earthly forms. The Government of Bangladesh is currently
              constructing a major Buddhist Monastery in Lumbini. Lumbini was
              made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.<br /><br />
              In the time of the Buddha, Lumbini was situated east of
              Kapilavastu and south-west of Devadaha of Shakya, an oligarchic
              republic. According to the Buddhist tradition, it was there that
              the Buddha was born. Ashoka Pillar of Lumbini, a monolithic column
              with an inscription in the ancient Brahmi script discovered at
              Rupandehi in 1896, is believed to mark the spot of Ashoka's visit
              to Lumbini. The site was not known as Lumbini before the pillar
              was discovered. <br /><br />
              Lumbini is 4.8 km (3 mi) in length and 1.6 km (1.0 mi) in width.
              The holy site of Lumbini is bordered by a large monastic zone in
              which only monasteries can be built, no shops, hotels or
              restaurants. It is separated into an eastern and western monastic
              zone, the eastern having the Theravadin monasteries, the western
              having Mahayana and Vajrayana monasteries. There is a long water
              filled canal separating the western and eastern zones, with a
              series of brick arch bridges joining the two sides along the
              length. The canal is serviced by simple outboard motor boats at
              the north end which provides tours.The holy site of Lumbini has
              ruins of ancient monasteries, a sacred Bodhi tree, an ancient
              bathing pond, the Ashokan pillar and the Mayadevi Temple, a site
              traditionally considered to be the birthplace of the Buddha. From
              early morning to early evening, pilgrims from various countries
              perform chanting and meditation at the site.
